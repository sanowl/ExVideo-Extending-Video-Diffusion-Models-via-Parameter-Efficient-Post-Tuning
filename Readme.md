# ExVideo: Extended Video Diffusion Model

## Overview

ExVideo is an implementation of the "ExVideo: Extending Video Diffusion Models via Parameter-Efficient Post-Tuning" approach. This project aims to enhance existing video synthesis models, allowing them to produce longer, high-quality videos while maintaining their original generalization capabilities.

## Features

- Extended temporal block architecture for longer video generation
- Parameter-efficient post-tuning strategy
- Integration with text-to-image models for diverse video generation
- Optimized training process with mixed precision, gradient checkpointing, and EMA
- Distributed training support using DeepSpeed
